# FinalProject
Final Project for FE-595 2019

If a person owns cryptocurrencies, they inevitably ask what they have gained or lost on their investment. 
For those who do not own any cryptocurrencies, a common question is what they could they have made (or lost) had they invested in the past.

With the volatility of cryptocurrency, we also wanted to provide a way for investors to project their risk and determine 
what’s a good time to perform any action that they’re currently thinking of related to the cryptocurrency that they own.
For our final project, this simple web answers those questions. 
1.	Select a coin, an investment value, and an investment date and you are returned the current value of that investment 
(real or imaginary) along with a graph of returns showing the minimum and maximum returns over time. 
Cryptocurrency data is pulled via a GET request from cryptocurrency.com’s api. 
That data is processed and graphed in my web app and presented back to the user.

2.	The user would be able to select a cryptocurrency and then after processing with machine learning and other prediction tools, 
we’ll be able to show them a graph indicating the predicted performance of their cryptocurrency along with an indication of its 
price based on a date.
